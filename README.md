# FacialEmotionRecognition

This is a convolutional autoencoder neural network that is trained to classify 6 different human facial emotions:
<li>angry</li>
<li>fear</li>
<li>happy</li>
<li>neutral</li>
<li>sad</li>
<li>surprise</li>
<br>
The dataset that is used to train this model is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013">FER 2013</a> dataset.
<br>
The convolutional autoencoder is able to achieve 64% accuracy.
<br>
In comparison, the convolutional autoencoder accuracy is ~3% higher than a convolutional neural network.
